## Git Diff

---

compares the changes between the working directory file and staged file  
`git diff `

compares the changes between staged file and file on the last commit  
`git diff --staged|--cached`

similar to git diff command but it will use a program to show the differences instead of showing
it in the terminal  
`git difftool`
